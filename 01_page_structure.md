## Exercise Two

Create a `GET /goodbye` route that returns a farewell message as an HTML page.
Write a test for it too.

The route should return this:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <strong>Bye!</strong>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then, make sure your server is running using `python app.py` and use your
web browser to access the page.
